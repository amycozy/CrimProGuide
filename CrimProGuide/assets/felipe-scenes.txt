Create a cartoon fox character named 'Felipe the Fourth Amendment Fox' representing protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. Felipe should have primarily forest green (#3E5641) fur with some darker accents. He should be wearing a shield-shaped badge with "4th" written on it. Felipe should have alert, vigilant eyes and perked-up ears, suggesting curiosity, attentiveness and protection. The character should appear protective but approachable, set against a subtle cream background. The style should be colorful and clean-lined, with a friendly yet professional appearance.
