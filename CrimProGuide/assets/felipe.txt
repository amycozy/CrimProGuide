Create a cartoon fox character named 'Felipe the Fourth Amendment Fox' representing protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. Felipe should have primarily forest green (#3E5641) fur with some darker accents. He should be wearing a shield-shaped badge with "4th" written on it. He is holding or standing near a small house with a little fence around it (representing privacy of the home). Felipe should have alert, vigilant eyes and perked-up ears, suggesting curiosity, attentiveness and protection. Include a magnifying glass in his hand to represent scrutiny of government actions. The character should appear protective but approachable, set against a subtle cream background. The style should be colorful and clean-lined, with a friendly yet professional appearance. At the bottom of the image, include the text 'FELIPE the Fourth Amendment Fox' in the same bold black font style as the other characters.
