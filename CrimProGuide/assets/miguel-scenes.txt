Create a cartoon macaw parrot character named 'Miguel the Miranda Macaw' representing Miranda Rights in criminal procedure law. Miguel should have primarily rust orange/red (#A24936) feathers with teal/green accents on the wings. He should be standing upright  Miguel should have a friendly but authoritative appearance with a distinctive curved beak and simple black eyes. Use the same flat, limited color palette style with thick black outlines as the other characters. The background should be a cream color (#F5F0DC). The illustration should maintain a simple, iconic approach with minimal shading or texturing, following the retro minimalist cartoon style.
