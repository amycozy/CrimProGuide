Create a cartoon tapir character named 'Tulio the Terry Stop Tapir' representing Terry Stops in criminal procedure law. Tulio should have dark charcoal/olive (#282B28) coloring with thick black outlines and minimal details. He should be standing upright wearing a brown detective/police hat. Tulio should have one paw raised in a clear 'stop' or 'wait' gesture. He should be wearing a golden police badge on his chest, with a black belt around his waist. Include a magnifying glass hanging from his neck or held in his other paw, and position a simple hourglass timer next to him to represent the brief, limited nature of Terry stops. The character should have a serious, vigilant expression with his distinctive tapir snout. Use the same flat, limited color palette style with thick black outlines as the other characters. The background should be a cream color (#F5F0DC). At the bottom of the image, include the text 'TULIO the Terry Stop Tapir' in bold black font. The illustration should maintain a simple, iconic approach with minimal shading or texturing, following the retro minimalist cartoon style.
