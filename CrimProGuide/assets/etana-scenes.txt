Create a cartoon elephant character in the same retro minimalist style as the reference images. The elephant should be bright orange (#D36135) with thick black outlines and minimal details.  She should be wearing simple judge elements - a collar and a robe. She is confident and gives an impression of stern wisdom, without looking cocky.  Use the same flat, limited color palette style with thick black outlines as seen in the existing character illustrations. The background should be the same cream color (#F5F0DC).  The illustration should maintain the same simple, iconic approach with minimal shading or texturing.
