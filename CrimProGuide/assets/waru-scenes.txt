Create a cartoon quokka character named 'Waru the Warrant Exception Quokka' representing Warrant Exceptions in criminal procedure law. Waru should have teal/sage green (#83BCA9) fur with thick black outlines and minimal details. He stands upright wearing a brown explorer/adventure hat. Attached to a belt around his waist, include a ring of golden keys representing legal access. Waru should have the characteristic quokka 'smile' with a friendly, approachable expression. Add a small exclamation point symbol next to him to represent urgency or special circumstances. The character should have simple round ears and a short tail. Use the same flat, limited color palette style with thick black outlines as the other characters. The background should be a cream color (#F5F0DC). The illustration should maintain a simple, iconic approach with minimal shading or texturing, following the retro minimalist cartoon style.
