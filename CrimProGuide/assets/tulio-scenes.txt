Create a cartoon tapir character named 'Tulio the Terry Stop Tapir' representing Terry Stops in criminal procedure law. Tulio should have dark charcoal/olive (#282B28) coloring with thick black outlines and minimal details. He should be standing upright wearing a brown detective/police hat. He should be wearing a golden police badge on his chest, with a black belt around his waist. Include a magnifying glass hanging from his neck. He is often serious, with a vigilant expression with his distinctive tapir snout. Use the same flat, limited color palette style with thick black outlines as the other characters. The background should be a cream color (#F5F0DC). The illustration should maintain a simple, iconic approach with minimal shading or texturing, following the retro minimalist cartoon style.
