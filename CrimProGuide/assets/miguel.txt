Create a cartoon macaw parrot character named 'Miguel the Miranda Macaw' representing Miranda Rights in criminal procedure law. Miguel should have primarily rust orange/red (#A24936) feathers with teal/green accents on the wings. He should be standing upright with one wing holding a scroll or paper clearly labeled 'RIGHTS' with three checkmarks below it. Include a speech bubble coming from his beak with the word 'WARNING' written inside it. Next to the character, add a police badge with a star and a set of golden keys. Miguel should have a friendly but authoritative appearance with a distinctive curved beak and simple black eyes. Use the same flat, limited color palette style with thick black outlines as the other characters. The background should be a cream color (#F5F0DC). At the bottom of the image, include the text 'MIGUEL the Miranda Macaw' in bold black font. The illustration should maintain a simple, iconic approach with minimal shading or texturing, following the retro minimalist cartoon style.
