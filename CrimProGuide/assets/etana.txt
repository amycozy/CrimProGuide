Create a cartoon elephant character in the same retro minimalist style as the reference images. The elephant should be bright orange (#D36135) with thick black outlines and minimal details. Etana should be standing upright, with her trunk raised to block entry. Her hands are on her hips. She should be wearing simple judge elements - a collar and a robe. Position a box or container labeled 'EVIDENCE' at her feet. Next to it, include a simple trash can with a paper sticking out labeled 'EXCLUDED'. Use the same flat, limited color palette style with thick black outlines as seen in the existing character illustrations. The background should be the same cream color (#F5F0DC). At the bottom of the image, include the text 'ETANA the Exclusionary Rule Elephant' in the same bold black font style as the other characters. The illustration should maintain the same simple, iconic approach with minimal shading or texturing.
