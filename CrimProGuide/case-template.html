<div class="case-box">
    <div class="case-header">
        <div class="case-name">Katz v. United States</div>
        <div class="case-citation">389 U.S. 347 (1967)</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-rule">
        <p>The Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. What a person knowingly exposes to the public is not protected, but what they seek to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-facts">
        <h4>Facts</h4>
        <p>FBI agents attached an electronic listening device to the outside of a public telephone booth used by Katz, who was suspected of transmitting gambling information across state lines. The recordings were used to convict Katz. The government argued no search occurred because there was no physical intrusion into the phone booth, and the phone booth was a public place.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-reasoning">
        <h4>Reasoning</h4>
        <p>The Supreme Court rejected the "trespass doctrine" that had previously governed Fourth Amendment analysis. Justice Stewart wrote that "the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places," establishing that physical intrusion is not necessary for a Fourth Amendment violation. The Court held that Katz had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his phone booth conversations despite being in a partially public location.</p>
        <p>Justice Harlan's concurrence outlined the now-standard two-part test for determining Fourth Amendment protection: (1) whether the individual has exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy, and (2) whether that expectation is one society is prepared to recognize as reasonable (objective).</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-implications">
        <p>Katz fundamentally transformed Fourth Amendment jurisprudence by shifting the focus from property rights to privacy expectations. The "reasonable expectation of privacy" test from Justice Harlan's concurrence became the dominant framework for analyzing Fourth Amendment claims, particularly for cases involving electronic surveillance and technology.</p>
