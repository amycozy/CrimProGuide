    <h3>Overview of the Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel</h3>
    
    <p>The Sixth Amendment provides that "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence." This right is fundamental to our adversarial system of justice, ensuring that the accused can meaningfully contest the government's case. The Supreme Court has interpreted this provision to include several distinct but related rights:</p>
    
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>Components of Right to Counsel</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to Retained Counsel</strong>: Right to hire and be represented by a lawyer of one's choosing</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Appointed Counsel</strong>: Right to have counsel appointed if indigent (<em>Gideon v. Wainwright</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Self-Representation</strong>: Right to proceed pro se if competent to do so (<em>Faretta v. California</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Conflict-Free Counsel</strong>: Right to representation free from conflicts of interest</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Effective Assistance</strong>: Right to counsel who provides reasonably effective assistance (<em>Strickland v. Washington</em>)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>The Sixth Amendment right to counsel serves multiple purposes: it enables the defendant to navigate complex legal procedures, protects against government overreach, ensures the reliability of the adversarial testing process, and promotes the legitimacy of the criminal justice system.</p>

    <h3>Attachment of the Right to Counsel</h3>
    
    <p>The Sixth Amendment right to counsel "attaches" only at or after the initiation of adversarial judicial criminal proceedings. This is a critical threshold that determines when the government's conduct is regulated by the Sixth Amendment rather than other constitutional provisions.</p>
    
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>When the Right Attaches</h4>
        <p>The Supreme Court has held that the right attaches at or after:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Formal charge</li>
            <li>Preliminary hearing</li>
            <li>Indictment</li>
            <li>Information</li>
            <li>Arraignment</li>
            <li>Initial appearance before judicial officer</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>The key consideration is whether "the government has committed itself to prosecute" and the defendant "finds himself faced with the prosecutorial forces of organized society." (<em>Kirby v. Illinois</em>)</p>
    
    <h4>Important Limitations</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Investigation vs. Prosecution</strong>: Pre-charge investigative activities are not governed by the Sixth Amendment, even if the suspect is the focus of an investigation</li>
        <li><strong>Offense-Specific</strong>: The right attaches only to the specific charged offense, not to other uncharged offenses (<em>Texas v. Cobb</em>)</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-attachment Interrogation</strong>: Statements obtained before attachment of the right are not subject to Sixth Amendment scrutiny, though they may implicate Fifth Amendment/Miranda protection</li>
        <li><strong>Critical Stages</strong>: Even after attachment, the right applies only at "critical stages" of the prosecution</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Critical Stages of Prosecution</h4>
    <p>After the right attaches, counsel is guaranteed only at "critical stages" of the prosecution, defined as proceedings where the defendant faces potential substantial prejudice and where counsel's assistance can help avoid that prejudice. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Post-indictment interrogations (<em>Massiah v. United States</em>)</li>
        <li>Post-indictment lineups and show-ups (<em>United States v. Wade</em>)</li>
        <li>Preliminary hearings where rights may be lost</li>
        <li>Arraignments where defenses must be asserted</li>
        <li>Plea negotiations and entry of plea</li>
        <li>Trial</li>
        <li>Sentencing</li>
        <li>First appeal as of right (<em>Douglas v. California</em>)</li>
    </ul>

<div class="case-box">
    <h4><span class="case-name">Rothgery v. Gillespie County</span> <span class="case-citation">554 U.S. 191 (2008)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">The Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches at a defendant's initial appearance before a judicial officer, where the defendant is informed of the charge against him and restrictions are imposed on his liberty, regardless of whether a prosecutor is involved in the proceeding.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">Rothgery was arrested based on an erroneous criminal record showing he was a felon. He was brought before a magistrate for an initial appearance (called a "magistration" under Texas law), where he was informed of the charge, his bail was set, and he was jailed. Despite multiple requests, he was not appointed counsel until six months after this initial appearance. After counsel was appointed, the attorney obtained evidence proving Rothgery had no prior felony conviction, and the charges were dismissed.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches at the initial appearance before a judicial officer, regardless of whether a prosecutor is aware of or involved in that proceeding. Justice Souter, writing for the majority, emphasized that attachment occurs when the defendant is brought before a judicial officer, informed of a formal accusation, and restrictions are imposed on his liberty. The Court rejected the county's argument that attachment requires prosecutorial awareness or involvement, noting that by the time of the initial appearance, the government has committed itself to prosecution. The Court clarified that while attachment triggers the right to counsel, counsel need only be appointed "within a reasonable time after attachment to allow for adequate representation at any critical stage before trial, as well as at trial itself." This decision resolved a circuit split regarding when the right to counsel attaches and emphasized the importance of the initial appearance as a significant step in a criminal prosecution.</p>

<div class="explanation" id="massiah">
    <h3>The Massiah Doctrine</h3>
    
    <p>The Massiah doctrine, named after <em>Massiah v. United States</em> (1964), prohibits the government from deliberately eliciting incriminating statements from a defendant after the right to counsel has attached and without counsel present or a valid waiver. This doctrine extends the Sixth Amendment's protection beyond formal interrogations to any situation where the government deliberately attempts to obtain incriminating information.</p>
    
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>Key Elements of Massiah Violation</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Attachment of Right</strong>: Formal criminal proceedings must have begun against the defendant</li>
            <li><strong>Deliberate Elicitation</strong>: Government must deliberately attempt to elicit incriminating information</li>
            <li><strong>Government Agent</strong>: The elicitation must be by a government agent (including informants, undercover officers, etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>Absence of Counsel</strong>: Counsel must be absent and the defendant must not have validly waived counsel</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Deliberate Elicitation vs. Miranda Interrogation</h4>
    <p>The Massiah standard of "deliberate elicitation" differs from Miranda's "custodial interrogation" standard:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No custody requirement under Massiah</li>
        <li>Includes more subtle forms of questioning or conversation designed to elicit incriminating responses</li>
        <li>Applies even when the defendant doesn't know they're speaking to a government agent (<em>United States v. Henry</em>)</li>
        <li>Mere listening or passive reception of information is not a violation (<em>Kuhlmann v. Wilson</em>)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Government Agents</h4>
    <p>A "government agent" for Massiah purposes includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Police officers and prosecutors</li>
        <li>Informants instructed to elicit information</li>
        <li>Co-defendants or cellmates working with the government</li>
        <li>Government-directed civilians</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Waiver of Massiah Rights</h4>
    <p>A defendant may waive Massiah rights, but the government bears a heavy burden of showing a valid waiver:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary</li>
        <li>Miranda warnings generally sufficient for explicit waiver (<em>Patterson v. Illinois</em>)</li>
        <li>No waiver if government actively conceals agent's identity</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><span class="case-name">Massiah v. United States</span> <span class="case-citation">377 U.S. 201 (1964)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">The government violates a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel when it deliberately elicits incriminating statements from the defendant after the right to counsel has attached, without counsel present and without a valid waiver.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">Massiah was indicted for federal narcotics violations, retained a lawyer, pleaded not guilty, and was released on bail. A co-defendant, Colson, agreed to cooperate with the government. He arranged a meeting with Massiah in Colson's car, where government agents had installed a radio transmitter. During their conversation, which was monitored by an agent, Massiah made incriminating statements that were later used against him at trial.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court held that the government violated Massiah's Sixth Amendment right to counsel by deliberately eliciting incriminating statements after he had been indicted and in the absence of his counsel. Justice Stewart, writing for the majority, emphasized that the right to counsel would be meaningless if the government could circumvent it by surreptitiously extracting incriminating statements. The Court noted that Massiah was denied the "basic protections" of the Sixth Amendment when government agents deliberately elicited incriminating statements from him after indictment and outside his lawyer's presence. This landmark decision established that the Sixth Amendment prohibits not just direct interrogation after formal charges, but any deliberate government effort to obtain incriminating statements from an accused without counsel present or a valid waiver.</p>

<div class="explanation" id="effective-assistance">
    <h3>Effective Assistance of Counsel</h3>
    
    <p>The Sixth Amendment right to counsel includes the right to effective assistance of counsel. In <em>Strickland v. Washington</em> (1984), the Supreme Court established a two-prong test for determining whether a defendant's right to effective assistance of counsel has been violated.</p>
    
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>The Strickland Test</h4>
        <p>To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Deficient Performance</strong>: Counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms</li>
            <li><strong>Prejudice</strong>: There is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Analyzing Deficient Performance</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strong Presumption of Competence</strong>: Courts must be highly deferential to counsel's judgments</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic Decisions</strong>: Tactical choices made after thorough investigation are virtually unchallengeable</li>
        <li><strong>Prevailing Professional Norms</strong>: Performance evaluated against objective standards of reasonableness</li>
        <li><strong>Contemporaneous Assessment</strong>: Judged based on circumstances at the time, not with hindsight</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Establishing Prejudice</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reasonable Probability</strong>: Less than a preponderance of evidence but sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome</li>
        <li><strong>Effect on Outcome</strong>: Must show that the error actually had an adverse effect on the defense</li>
        <li><strong>Fundamental Fairness</strong>: Focus on whether the trial produced a just result, not whether counsel's errors affected the outcome</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Per Se Prejudice Situations</h4>
    <p>In certain circumstances, prejudice is presumed without requiring specific proof:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Actual or Constructive Denial of Counsel</strong>: Complete absence of counsel at critical stage</li>
        <li><strong>State Interference</strong>: Government interference with counsel's ability to represent defendant</li>
        <li><strong>Actual Conflict of Interest</strong>: Counsel labors under actual conflict that adversely affects performance (<em>Cuyler v. Sullivan</em>)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="case-box">
    <h4><span class="case-name">Strickland v. Washington</span> <span class="case-citation">466 U.S. 668 (1984)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that (1) counsel's performance was deficient, falling below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense, creating a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the result would have been different.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">Washington pleaded guilty to multiple murder charges against the advice of his appointed counsel. At the sentencing hearing, counsel did minimal preparation, not seeking character witnesses or requesting a psychiatric examination. Counsel's strategy was to rely on Washington's acceptance of responsibility and remorse, but the judge sentenced him to death.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court established a two-part test for evaluating claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Justice O'Connor, writing for the majority, emphasized the need for objective standards while maintaining deference to counsel's strategic decisions. For the performance prong, the Court held that a defendant must show counsel's representation fell below an "objective standard of reasonableness" under "prevailing professional norms." For the prejudice prong, the defendant must show a "reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different." The Court stressed that judicial scrutiny of counsel's performance must be "highly deferential" and courts must apply a "strong presumption" of competence. Applying this test, the Court found that Washington's counsel's conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance, and even if it hadn't, Washington failed to show prejudice. This case established the standard that continues to govern ineffective assistance claims.</p>
</div>

<div class="explanation" id="offense-specific">
    <h3>Offense-Specific Nature of the Right to Counsel</h3>
    
    <p>The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is "offense specific," meaning it attaches only to the specific charged offense for which formal proceedings have been initiated. This limitation has significant implications for police investigations involving defendants who have already been charged with certain crimes but are also suspected of other, uncharged offenses.</p>
    
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>Key Aspects of the Offense-Specific Limitation</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Limited Scope</strong>: The right to counsel does not extend to uncharged crimes, even if they are related to charged offenses</li>
            <li><strong>Same Offense Test</strong>: The <em>Blockburger</em> double jeopardy test is used to determine whether two offenses are the "same" for Sixth Amendment purposes</li>
            <li><strong>Distinction from Fifth Amendment</strong>: Unlike Sixth Amendment protection, Miranda's Fifth Amendment protection is not offense-specific</li>
            <li><strong>Practical Effect</strong>: Police may question a defendant about uncharged crimes without violating the Sixth Amendment, even if the defendant has counsel for other charged crimes</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h4>The Blockburger Test</h4>
    <p>In <em>Texas v. Cobb</em> (2001), the Supreme Court adopted the <em>Blockburger</em> test to determine whether two offenses are the "same" for Sixth Amendment purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Two offenses are not the same if "each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not"</li>
        <li>If each offense contains an element not found in the other, they are different offenses for Sixth Amendment purposes</li>
        <li>Factual relationship or overlap between offenses is not sufficient to make them the "same offense"</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Implications for Law Enforcement</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Police may question a defendant about crimes for which formal charges have not been filed</li>
        <li>Such questioning does not violate the Sixth Amendment, even if the defendant has counsel for other charged crimes</li>
        <li>However, Fifth Amendment/Miranda protections still apply if the questioning is custodial</li>
        <li>If a valid Miranda waiver is obtained, statements about uncharged crimes may be admissible</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="case-box">
    <h4><span class="case-name">Texas v. Cobb</span> <span class="case-citation">532 U.S. 162 (2001)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is offense-specific and does not extend to uncharged crimes, even if they are factually related to charged offenses. The test for determining whether two offenses are the "same" is the Blockburger double jeopardy test.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">While under arrest for burglary, Cobb confessed to murdering a woman and child during that burglary. He had been indicted only for the burglary and had been appointed counsel for that charge. Before confessing to the murders, Cobb was released on bond, went to live with his father, and confessed the murders to his father, who contacted the police. Police arrested Cobb and, after giving Miranda warnings, obtained his confession to the murders without notifying his attorney for the burglary charge.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court held that Cobb's confession to the murders was admissible because the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is offense-specific and does not extend to uncharged crimes, even when they are factually related to a charged offense. Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the majority, explained that the Court had consistently held the right to counsel to be "offense specific," and declined to adopt a broader "factually related" exception. The Court further clarified that the proper test for determining whether two offenses are the "same" is the Blockburger double jeopardy test—whether each offense requires proof of a fact that the other does not. Applying this test, the Court found that burglary and murder were not the "same offense," as each required proof of elements not required by the other. Therefore, police were free to question Cobb about the murders without notifying his burglary attorney, provided they obtained a valid waiver of his Miranda rights.</p>
</div>

<div class="case-box">
    <h4><span class="case-name">McNeil v. Wisconsin</span> <span class="case-citation">501 U.S. 171 (1991)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is offense-specific; invoking it for one charge does not invoke it for other uncharged offenses.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">McNeil was arrested for an armed robbery in West Allis, Wisconsin, and was represented by a public defender at his bail hearing for that charge. While in jail, police questioned him about an unrelated murder and other crimes in Caledonia, Wisconsin. After receiving and waiving his Miranda rights, McNeil made incriminating statements about the Caledonia crimes. He sought to suppress these statements, arguing that his invocation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel for the West Allis robbery charge should have prevented police from questioning him about any other crimes.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court held that McNeil's statements regarding the Caledonia crimes were admissible because the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is offense-specific. Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, explained that the Sixth Amendment right "cannot be invoked once for all future prosecutions," and attaches only to charged offenses. The Court distinguished the Sixth Amendment right to counsel from the Fifth Amendment/Miranda right, noting that if McNeil had invoked his Miranda right to counsel (rather than just his Sixth Amendment right), police would have been barred from initiating further questioning on any offense. The Court rejected the argument that invocation of the Sixth Amendment right should automatically invoke the Miranda right, as this would unnecessarily prevent police from questioning a suspect about unrelated crimes.</p>
</div>

<div class="explanation" id="waiver">
    <h3>Waiver of Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel</h3>
    
    <p>A defendant may waive their Sixth Amendment right to counsel, allowing police to question them without their attorney present, even after the right has attached. The requirements for a valid waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel have evolved over time.</p>
    
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>Requirements for Valid Waiver</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Knowing, Intelligent, and Voluntary</strong>: Waiver must be made with full awareness of the right being abandoned and the consequences of doing so</li>
            <li><strong>Miranda Warnings Sufficient</strong>: In many cases, the standard Miranda warnings, if understood, are sufficient to inform a defendant of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel</li>
            <li><strong>No Special Invocation Required</strong>: After <em>Montejo v. Louisiana</em> (2009), defendants must affirmatively invoke the right to counsel; appointment or retention of counsel does not automatically trigger protection</li>
            <li><strong>Re-initiation of Contact</strong>: Once a defendant invokes the right to counsel, police cannot re-initiate questioning unless counsel is present</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Montejo v. Louisiana: Changing the Framework</h4>
    <p>In <em>Montejo v. Louisiana</em> (2009), the Supreme Court overruled its prior decision in <em>Michigan v. Jackson</em> (1986), which had held that police could not initiate questioning of a defendant who had requested counsel at an arraignment or similar proceeding. Key aspects of the <em>Montejo</em> framework include:</p>

    <h4><span class="case-name">Montejo v. Louisiana</span> <span class="case-citation">556 U.S. 778 (2009)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">A defendant's request for or acceptance of counsel at an arraignment or similar proceeding does not automatically trigger Sixth Amendment protection against police-initiated questioning; defendants must actively invoke their right to have counsel present during interrogation.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">Montejo was arrested for murder and appeared before a judge for a preliminary hearing, where counsel was appointed for him. Later that day, police took him from jail to locate the murder weapon. Before the trip, Montejo received Miranda warnings and waived his rights. During the trip, he wrote an incriminating letter of apology to the victim's widow. His appointed counsel was not notified about the excursion.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court held that Montejo's letter was potentially admissible, overruling <em>Michigan v. Jackson</em>, which had established that once a defendant requests counsel at an arraignment, police may not initiate interrogation without counsel present. Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, reasoned that <em>Jackson</em>'s protective rule was unnecessary because Miranda and related Fifth Amendment jurisprudence already provide sufficient protection to defendants. The Court established that a defendant must affirmatively invoke the right to counsel to trigger Sixth Amendment protection against police-initiated questioning. The mere appointment of counsel does not constitute an invocation. The Court emphasized that "what matters for Miranda and [Edwards v. Arizona] is what happens when the defendant is approached for interrogation, not what happened at any preliminary hearing." The case was remanded to determine whether Montejo's waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.</p>

    <h4><span class="case-name">Brewer v. Williams</span> <span class="case-citation">430 U.S. 387 (1977)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">Police violate a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel when they deliberately elicit incriminating information after formal charges have been filed and in the absence of counsel or a valid waiver.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">Williams was arrested for the murder of a 10-year-old girl and arraigned in Davenport, Iowa, where he was represented by a lawyer. He was then transported to Des Moines, about 160 miles away. Before the trip, his lawyer instructed police not to question Williams during the journey. During the drive, a detective delivered the now-famous "Christian burial speech," telling Williams that the girl's parents deserved to give their daughter a proper Christian burial and that the snow would soon cover any evidence. Williams, who was deeply religious, eventually directed police to the girl's body.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court held that the detective's "Christian burial speech" was the functional equivalent of interrogation and violated Williams' Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Justice Stewart, writing for the majority, found that the detective had "deliberately and designedly set out to elicit information from Williams just as surely as—and perhaps more effectively than—if he had formally interrogated him." The Court rejected the state's argument that Williams had waived his right to counsel, finding that the prosecution had failed to prove "an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege." This case is significant for establishing that "deliberate elicitation" of incriminating information, even without direct questioning, violates the Sixth Amendment if formal proceedings have begun and counsel is not present.</p>

    <h4><span class="case-name">Fellers v. United States</span> <span class="case-citation">540 U.S. 519 (2004)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">Officers violate a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel when they deliberately elicit information about an indicted offense during a post-indictment interaction without counsel present, even when the interaction does not constitute custodial interrogation under Miranda.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">After Fellers was indicted for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, police officers went to his home to arrest him. Upon arriving, they told him they had a warrant for his arrest and that they wanted to discuss his involvement in methamphetamine distribution and his associations with certain co-conspirators. Fellers made incriminating statements at his home. Later, at the jail, he was given Miranda warnings, waived his rights, and reiterated his earlier statements.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court unanimously held that the officers deliberately elicited incriminating information from Fellers at his home after he had been indicted and in the absence of counsel, violating his Sixth Amendment rights. Justice O'Connor, writing for the Court, emphasized that the Sixth Amendment standard of "deliberate elicitation" is distinct from the Fifth Amendment's "custodial interrogation" standard. The fact that Fellers was not in custody when he made the statements at his home was irrelevant to the Sixth Amendment analysis; what mattered was that he had been indicted and was being deliberately questioned about the indicted offense without counsel present. The Court remanded the case to determine whether the jailhouse statements, made after Miranda warnings, should be suppressed as fruits of the initial Sixth Amendment violation.</p>

    <h4><span class="case-name">Kansas v. Ventris</span> <span class="case-citation">556 U.S. 586 (2009)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">Statements obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel may be used to impeach a defendant's inconsistent testimony at trial, even though they are inadmissible in the prosecution's case-in-chief.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">Ventris was charged with murder and robbery. Before trial, police placed an informant in his cell to obtain incriminating information. The informant testified that Ventris confessed to the shooting. At trial, Ventris testified that his co-defendant was the shooter. The prosecution then introduced the informant's testimony to impeach Ventris.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court held that statements obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel may be used for impeachment purposes. Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, distinguished between the constitutional violation itself—which occurs at the time of the uncounseled interrogation—and the use of the evidence at trial. The Court explained that the core of the Sixth Amendment right is "the opportunity for a defendant to consult with an attorney and to have him investigate the case and prepare a defense for trial." Once this right has been violated, the focus shifts to the remedial question of what consequences should flow from that violation. The Court reasoned that while exclusion from the prosecution's case-in-chief serves to deter police misconduct, allowing the statement for impeachment strikes a better balance between the competing interests of deterrence and the search for truth. The Court concluded that "the game of excluding tainted evidence for impeachment purposes is not worth the candle."</p>

    <h4><span class="case-name">Gideon v. Wainwright</span> <span class="case-citation">372 U.S. 335 (1963)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is fundamental and essential to a fair trial, and this right requires that counsel be appointed for indigent defendants in state criminal prosecutions.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">Clarence Earl Gideon was charged with breaking and entering a poolroom with intent to commit a misdemeanor, a felony under Florida law. When he appeared in court without funds and asked the court to appoint counsel for him, the judge refused, stating that Florida law only required appointment of counsel in capital cases. Gideon conducted his own defense and was convicted. From prison, he filed a handwritten petition to the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court unanimously overruled <em>Betts v. Brady</em> (1942), which had held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel was not a fundamental right essential to a fair trial and thus not applicable to the states. Justice Black, writing for the Court, emphasized that lawyers in criminal courts are "necessities, not luxuries" and that the "noble ideal" of ensuring fair trials cannot be realized if the poor person charged with a crime must face his accusers without a lawyer. The Court noted that governments spend vast sums to establish prosecutorial systems and to try defendants, recognizing the immense importance of counsel in criminal cases. This landmark decision established that states must provide counsel to criminal defendants who cannot afford their own attorneys, significantly expanding access to legal representation and fundamentally changing the criminal justice system.</p>
