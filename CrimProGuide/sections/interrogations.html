    <h3>Fifth Amendment Protection Against Self-Incrimination</h3>
    
    <p>The Fifth Amendment provides that no person "shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself." This constitutional protection is the foundation of rules governing police interrogations and forms the basis for the Miranda doctrine. The privilege applies in any setting where the government seeks to compel potentially incriminating testimony.</p>
    
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>Key Aspects of the Fifth Amendment Privilege</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compulsion Requirement</strong>: The privilege protects against compelled testimonial self-incrimination</li>
            <li><strong>Testimonial Evidence</strong>: Only applies to communicative or testimonial evidence, not physical evidence</li>
            <li><strong>Self-Incrimination</strong>: Statement must tend to incriminate the individual</li>
            <li><strong>Criminal Case</strong>: Protects against use in criminal proceedings, though may be invoked in civil or administrative proceedings if criminal liability is possible</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Right</strong>: Can only be invoked for oneself, not on behalf of others</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>The Supreme Court has recognized that custodial interrogations can be inherently coercive environments. In <em>Miranda v. Arizona</em> (1966), the Court established procedural safeguards to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege in the context of custodial interrogations.</p>

    <h3>Due Process Voluntariness Test</h3>
    
    <p>Before <em>Miranda</em>, the Supreme Court evaluated the admissibility of confessions under a Due Process "voluntariness" test. This test, which continues to apply alongside Miranda, focuses on whether a confession was the product of the suspect's free and rational choice or was involuntarily extracted through coercion.</p>
    
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>Factors in Voluntariness Analysis</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Police Conduct</strong>: Nature and degree of coercion, including physical force, threats, deception, and psychological pressure</li>
            <li><strong>Suspect Characteristics</strong>: Age, education, intelligence, mental state, and prior experience with law enforcement</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Factors</strong>: Length of detention, deprivation of basic needs, access to outside contact</li>
            <li><strong>Totality of Circumstances</strong>: All factors considered together rather than in isolation</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>A confession deemed involuntary under the Due Process test is inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment. This is a broader prohibition than for Miranda violations, which may be used for certain limited purposes.</p>
    
    <h4>Police Conduct Rendering Confessions Involuntary</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Physical abuse or threats of violence</li>
        <li>Extended periods of interrogation without rest</li>
        <li>Deprivation of food, water, or sleep</li>
        <li>Threats against family members</li>
        <li>Extreme psychological coercion</li>
        <li>False promises that induce confessions</li>
        <li>Exploitation of mental illness or intellectual disability</li>
    </ul>

<div class="case-box">
    <h4><span class="case-name">Brown v. Mississippi</span> <span class="case-citation">297 U.S. 278 (1936)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">Admission of confession obtained through physical torture violates due process.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">The defendants, all Black men, were convicted of murder solely on the basis of confessions obtained through extreme physical torture, including repeated whippings and hanging from a tree. The confessions contained details that were dictated to them by the officers.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court held that the use of confessions obtained through this extreme violence violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, despite the Bill of Rights not yet being incorporated to the states. Chief Justice Hughes emphasized that while states could establish their own rules of criminal procedure, they could not substitute "trial by ordeal." The Court noted that "the rack and torture chamber may not be substituted for the witness stand" and that confessions obtained through such methods are offensive to fundamental principles of justice. This case established that physical coercion by police renders a confession involuntary and thus inadmissible.</p>

<div class="case-box">
    <h4><span class="case-name">Chambers v. Florida</span> <span class="case-citation">309 U.S. 227 (1940)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">Psychological coercion through prolonged interrogation without access to friends, family, or counsel can render confessions involuntary and violate due process.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">Following the murder of an elderly white man, police arrested dozens of Black men, including Chambers, and subjected them to days of continuous questioning without access to family, friends, or counsel. After five days of this treatment, the defendants confessed.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court unanimously held that the confessions were involuntary and their use violated due process. Justice Black emphasized that even in the absence of physical torture, psychological coercion through prolonged, isolated, and relentless questioning could overcome a person's will. The Court noted that the methods used—mass arrests without suspicion, prolonged isolation, and ceaseless questioning—were not necessary to uphold the law and instead represented coercive abuse of power. This case extended the constitutional protections against coerced confessions beyond just physical torture to include psychological pressure.</p>

<div class="case-box">
    <h4><span class="case-name">Spano v. New York</span> <span class="case-citation">360 U.S. 315 (1959)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">Psychological pressure through persistent questioning, fatigue, and exploitation of personal relationships can render a confession involuntary under the totality of circumstances.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">Spano, a man with only six months of education and a history of emotional instability, was subjected to eight hours of continuous questioning by multiple officers after being formally charged with murder. He had already obtained counsel who advised him to remain silent. Police used his childhood friend, a police officer in training, to falsely claim that the friend would lose his job if Spano didn't confess.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court held that the confession was involuntary and violated due process. Chief Justice Warren noted that the circumstances—including Spano's limited education, emotional challenges, the duration and intensity of questioning, the exploitation of friendship, and his mounting fatigue—demonstrated that the officers felt they could overcome his will. The Court emphasized the impropriety of the tactics used to obtain the confession, especially after formal charges had been filed and counsel had been retained. This case reinforced that psychological coercion, even without physical abuse, can render a confession involuntary under the totality of circumstances.</p>

<div class="case-box">
    <h4><span class="case-name">Colorado v. Connelly</span> <span class="case-citation">479 U.S. 157 (1986)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">Coercive police activity is a necessary predicate to finding that a confession is involuntary under the Due Process Clause. Mental illness alone, without police coercion, does not render a confession involuntary.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">Connelly approached a police officer on the street and confessed to a murder. At the time, he appeared normal, was advised of his Miranda rights, and waived them. Later, it was discovered that Connelly suffered from chronic schizophrenia and was experiencing command hallucinations telling him to confess or commit suicide. A psychiatrist testified that Connelly's psychosis motivated his confession.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court held that Connelly's confession was voluntary for Due Process purposes, despite his mental illness. Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the majority, emphasized that police coercion is a necessary element of an involuntary confession claim. The Court reasoned that the purpose of excluding involuntary confessions is to deter police misconduct, not to ensure the reliability of confessions. While acknowledging that mental illness might affect the reliability of a confession, the Court held that this concern should be addressed through state evidence law regarding reliability, not through constitutional Due Process analysis. The Court explicitly rejected the notion that the "fundamental fairness" guaranteed by the Due Process Clause is concerned with internal psychological factors in the absence of police coercion.</p>

<div class="case-box">
    <h4><span class="case-name">Arizona v. Fulminante</span> <span class="case-citation">499 U.S. 279 (1991)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">A confession obtained through implicit threats of physical violence from another person, with police knowledge and exploitation of the danger, is involuntary and violates due process.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">While in prison on unrelated charges, Fulminante befriended another inmate, Sarivola, who was a paid FBI informant. Sarivola told Fulminante he knew Fulminante was suspected of killing his stepdaughter and offered protection from other inmates (who had been threatening Fulminante) in exchange for details about the murder. Fulminante confessed, and Sarivola reported the confession to the FBI.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court held that Fulminante's confession was coerced and should not have been admitted at trial. The Court found that the confession was obtained as a direct result of Sarivola's promise of protection from credible threats of physical violence, and that Fulminante confessed out of fear. Importantly, the Court noted that coercion could be mental or physical, and that the threat of physical violence was sufficient to render the confession involuntary. Because law enforcement was aware of the threat to Fulminante and Sarivola was acting as their agent, the state action requirement for a due process violation was satisfied. The Court also held that the admission of a coerced confession is subject to harmless error analysis.</p>

    <h3>Miranda Rights and Requirements</h3>
    
    <p>In <em>Miranda v. Arizona</em> (1966), the Supreme Court established procedural safeguards to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination during custodial interrogations. These safeguards require police to inform suspects of specific rights before custodial interrogation.</p>
    
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>The Miranda Warnings</h4>
        <p>Before custodial interrogation, suspects must be warned that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>They have the right to remain silent</li>
            <li>Anything they say can and will be used against them in court</li>
            <li>They have the right to consult with an attorney and to have the attorney present during questioning</li>
            <li>If they cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for them</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The exact wording of these warnings is not critical as long as they effectively convey the substance of these rights.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Triggering Miranda: Custody + Interrogation</h4>
    <p>Miranda warnings are required only when a suspect is both (1) in custody and (2) subject to interrogation:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Custody Analysis</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Objective test: Whether a reasonable person would feel free to terminate the encounter and leave</li>
        <li>Not limited to formal arrest; includes "restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with formal arrest"</li>
        <li>Relevant factors: Location, duration, restraints, presence of multiple officers, display of weapons, physical contact, language used, whether suspect was told they were free to leave</li>
        <li>Special considerations:
            <ul>
                <li>Traffic stops generally not custody (<em>Berkemer v. McCarty</em>)</li>
                <li>Terry stops generally not custody</li>
                <li>Detention in one's home may be custody (<em>Orozco v. Texas</em>)</li>
                <li>Prison inmates not automatically in Miranda custody (<em>Howes v. Fields</em>)</li>
                <li>Child's age is relevant to custody analysis (<em>J.D.B. v. North Carolina</em>)</li>

    <p><strong>Interrogation Analysis</strong></p>

        <li>Express questioning about crime</li>
        <li>Functional equivalent: Words or actions police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response (<em>Rhode Island v. Innis</em>)</li>
        <li>Booking questions exception: Routine booking questions not designed to elicit incriminating responses</li>
        <li>Spontaneous statements not made in response to interrogation do not require Miranda warnings</li>

    <h4><span class="case-name">Miranda v. Arizona</span> <span class="case-citation">384 U.S. 436 (1966)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">Prior to any custodial interrogation, a person must be warned that they have the right to remain silent, that anything they say can be used against them in court, that they have the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if they cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for them.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">Ernesto Miranda was arrested for kidnapping and rape. He was interrogated for two hours without being advised of his rights, ultimately signing a confession. The confession included a typed paragraph stating the confession was voluntary and made with full knowledge of legal rights, but Miranda was not specifically informed of his right to counsel.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court held that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination applies to custodial police interrogations, which contain "inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual's will to resist and to compel him to speak." To counteract these pressures, the Court mandated procedural safeguards, now known as the Miranda warnings. Chief Justice Warren, writing for the majority, emphasized that these warnings are necessary to ensure suspects can exercise their constitutional rights, as the right to remain silent would be meaningless if suspects were unaware of it. The Court noted that statements obtained without these warnings are presumptively the product of compulsion and therefore inadmissible. The Court emphasized that after the warnings, a suspect may knowingly and intelligently waive these rights, but the prosecution bears the heavy burden of proving waiver.</p>

    <h4><span class="case-name">Orozco v. Texas</span> <span class="case-citation">394 U.S. 324 (1969)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">Miranda warnings are required when a suspect is in custody, even if the questioning occurs in the suspect's home rather than at a police station.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">Four police officers entered Orozco's boarding house bedroom at 4 a.m., surrounding his bed. When questioned, Orozco admitted owning a gun and told them where it was hidden. The officers testified that Orozco was "under arrest" and "not free to leave" from the moment they entered the room, though they had not formally arrested him.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court held that Orozco was in custody at the time of questioning, making Miranda warnings necessary before interrogation. Justice Black, writing for the majority, emphasized that Miranda does not require confinement in a police station for a suspect to be "in custody." The critical factor was that Orozco was under arrest and not free to leave—conditions creating the kind of police-dominated atmosphere Miranda was designed to address. The Court stated that official restraint on movement is necessary for custody but need not take place at the police station. The Court rejected the state's argument that the questioning was merely investigatory, noting that the officers admitted Orozco was not free to leave.</p>
</div>

<div class="case-box">
    <h4><span class="case-name">Rhode Island v. Innis</span> <span class="case-citation">446 U.S. 291 (1980)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">Interrogation under Miranda refers not only to express questioning but also to its functional equivalent—words or actions that police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">After being arrested for murder and advised of his Miranda rights, Innis invoked his right to counsel. While transporting him to the police station, officers discussed the missing murder weapon, expressing concern that handicapped children from a nearby school might find it and hurt themselves. Overhearing this conversation, Innis interrupted and led police to the weapon.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court held that the officers' conversation did not constitute interrogation under Miranda. Justice Stewart, writing for the majority, defined "interrogation" to include not only direct questioning but also words or actions that police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. Applying this standard, the Court found that the officers' conversation was not directed at Innis and that there was no reason to believe he would be particularly susceptible to an appeal about the safety of handicapped children. The brief conversation was not a "lengthy harangue" and did not appear calculated to elicit a response. The Court emphasized that the definition of interrogation focuses on the perceptions of the suspect, not the intent of the police, though police intent may be relevant in determining whether they should have known their actions were likely to elicit a response.</p>
</div>

<div class="case-box">
    <h4><span class="case-name">Illinois v. Perkins</span> <span class="case-citation">496 U.S. 292 (1990)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">Miranda warnings are not required when an undercover law enforcement officer questions a suspect who is in custody but unaware of the officer's true identity.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">While Perkins was in jail on unrelated charges, police placed an undercover officer in his cell. The undercover officer and another inmate engaged Perkins in conversation about a prison escape, during which Perkins made incriminating statements about a murder. No Miranda warnings were given before this conversation.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court held that Miranda warnings are not required when an incarcerated suspect speaks with an undercover agent. Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority, reasoned that the coercive atmosphere Miranda was designed to address is absent when a suspect does not know he is speaking with law enforcement. The Court noted that "when a suspect considers himself in the company of cellmates and not officers, the coercive atmosphere is lacking." The compulsion that Miranda was designed to combat—the pressure of custodial interrogation by known police officers—simply doesn't exist in this scenario. The Court distinguished this situation from the Sixth Amendment context, where questioning by undercover agents is prohibited after formal charges have been filed. Here, Perkins was still under investigation and had not yet been charged with the murder.</p>

    <h4><span class="case-name">J.D.B. v. North Carolina</span> <span class="case-citation">564 U.S. 261 (2011)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">A child's age is a relevant factor in determining whether the child is in custody for Miranda purposes, so long as the child's age was known to the officer or would have been objectively apparent.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">J.D.B., a 13-year-old seventh-grade student, was removed from his classroom and questioned in a closed conference room at school by police and school administrators about a series of burglaries. He was not given Miranda warnings or the opportunity to speak with his guardian. After being confronted with stolen items and told that "the truth would help him," J.D.B. confessed.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court held that a child's age is a relevant factor in the Miranda custody analysis. Justice Sotomayor, writing for the majority, emphasized that children are more susceptible to pressure from police and may feel bound to submit to questioning when an adult would feel free to leave. The Court rejected the state's argument that age would complicate the objective custody test, noting that considering age doesn't require officers to anticipate idiosyncratic characteristics of every suspect. The Court distinguished age from other personal traits, explaining that children "generally are less mature and responsible than adults" and that these differences are objectively verifiable. While not determinative, a child's age must be considered when it is known to the officer or would have been objectively apparent. The case was remanded to determine whether J.D.B. was in custody when he confessed.</p>

<div class="explanation" id="miranda-waiver">
    <h3>Waiver of Miranda Rights</h3>
    
    <p>After Miranda warnings are given, a suspect may waive their rights and agree to speak with law enforcement. For such a waiver to be valid, it must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. The prosecution bears the burden of proving a valid waiver.</p>
    
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>Requirements for Valid Waiver</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Voluntary</strong>: Free from coercion, intimidation, or deception</li>
            <li><strong>Knowing and Intelligent</strong>: With full awareness of the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it</li>
            <li><strong>Form of Waiver</strong>: May be express (verbal or written) or implied through conduct</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Express vs. Implied Waivers</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Express Waiver</strong>: Defendant explicitly states (orally or in writing) that they waive their rights (<em>North Carolina v. Butler</em>)</li>
        <li><strong>Implied Waiver</strong>: Defendant demonstrates understanding of rights but chooses to speak anyway (<em>Berghuis v. Thompkins</em>)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Factors Courts Consider</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Defendant's age, education, intelligence, and mental state</li>
        <li>Prior experience with criminal justice system</li>
        <li>Length and conditions of detention</li>
        <li>Nature of interrogation</li>
        <li>Whether rights were explained in a language the defendant understands</li>
        <li>Whether defendant was under the influence of drugs or alcohol</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Invoking Miranda Rights</h4>
    <p>Suspects may invoke their Miranda rights during questioning, which requires police to cease interrogation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to Silence</strong>: Must be invoked unambiguously; silence alone is not enough (<em>Berghuis v. Thompkins</em>)</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Counsel</strong>: Must also be unambiguous (<em>Davis v. United States</em>), e.g., "I want a lawyer"</li>
        <li><strong>Effect of Invocation</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>Right to silence: Questioning must cease, but may resume after a break with fresh Miranda warnings if right to silence is "scrupulously honored" (<em>Michigan v. Mosley</em>)</li>
                <li>Right to counsel: All questioning must cease until attorney is present or defendant initiates further communication (<em>Edwards v. Arizona</em>, <em>Oregon v. Bradshaw</em>)</li>
                <li>Request for non-attorney (e.g., probation officer) is not equivalent to requesting counsel (<em>Fare v. Michael C.</em>)</li>

    <h4><span class="case-name">North Carolina v. Butler</span> <span class="case-citation">441 U.S. 369 (1979)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">An explicit statement of waiver is not invariably necessary to support a finding that a defendant has waived Miranda rights; waiver can be inferred from the defendant's actions and words.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">After being arrested for armed robbery, Butler was advised of his Miranda rights and indicated he understood them. When asked to sign a waiver form, he stated, "I will talk to you but I am not signing any form." He then made incriminating statements but did not explicitly say he was waiving his rights.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court held that an explicit waiver is not invariably required to establish a valid waiver of Miranda rights. Justice Stewart, writing for the majority, reasoned that while the prosecution bears a heavy burden to prove waiver, that waiver need not be explicit. The Court stated that "in at least some cases waiver can be clearly inferred from the actions and words of the person interrogated." The Court rejected both extreme positions: that silence alone can constitute waiver (it cannot), and that an explicit statement is always required (it is not). Instead, the question of waiver must be determined based on the totality of the circumstances, including the suspect's background, experience, and conduct. The case was remanded for the lower courts to apply this standard.</p>

    <h4><span class="case-name">Berghuis v. Thompkins</span> <span class="case-citation">560 U.S. 370 (2010)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">A suspect must unambiguously invoke their right to remain silent, and a waiver of Miranda rights may be implied by a suspect who understands their rights but engages in a course of conduct indicating waiver, such as making an uncoerced statement to police.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">After being arrested for murder, Thompkins was given Miranda warnings and acknowledged understanding them but did not explicitly agree to talk. He remained largely silent during a three-hour interrogation, giving only occasional one-word responses. Eventually, he answered "yes" when asked if he prayed to God for forgiveness for shooting the victim. Thompkins moved to suppress this statement, arguing he had invoked his right to remain silent by remaining silent.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court held that Thompkins did not invoke his right to remain silent by remaining silent, ruling that invocation of this right must be unambiguous and unequivocal. Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority, noted that if police are unsure whether a suspect has invoked their rights, they are not required to end questioning. Additionally, the Court held that Thompkins had impliedly waived his Miranda rights by answering the detective's question after receiving and understanding the warnings. The Court established that a waiver can be implied from "the defendant's silence, coupled with an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver." This decision placed the burden on suspects to clearly invoke their right to remain silent and established that answering questions after receiving Miranda warnings can constitute an implied waiver of rights.</p>

    <h3>Exceptions to Miranda Requirements</h3>
    
    <p>The Supreme Court has recognized several exceptions to the Miranda rule, situations where statements obtained without Miranda warnings may still be admissible or where the consequences of a Miranda violation are limited.</p>
    
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>Key Miranda Exceptions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Public Safety Exception</strong>: Miranda warnings not required when questions are necessary to address an immediate threat to public safety (<em>New York v. Quarles</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>Impeachment Use</strong>: Statements obtained in violation of Miranda may be used to impeach a defendant's testimony at trial</li>
            <li><strong>Physical Evidence</strong>: Physical evidence discovered as a result of un-Mirandized but voluntary statements is admissible</li>
            <li><strong>Routine Booking Questions</strong>: Administrative questions about name, address, etc., do not require Miranda warnings</li>
            <li><strong>Spontaneous Statements</strong>: Volunteered statements not made in response to questioning</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Public Safety Exception</h4>
    <p>In <em>New York v. Quarles</em> (1984), the Supreme Court recognized that when officers ask questions "reasonably prompted by a concern for public safety" rather than solely to obtain incriminating evidence, Miranda warnings may be dispensed with. This typically involves situations where immediate questioning is needed to locate a weapon, defuse a dangerous situation, or prevent imminent harm.</p>
    
    <h4>Midstream Miranda Warnings</h4>
    <p>The Court has addressed the issue of "question first, warn later" tactics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Oregon v. Elstad (1985)</strong>: When initial unwarned questioning is not coercive, a subsequent warned confession may be admissible if voluntary</li>
        <li><strong>Missouri v. Seibert (2004)</strong>: When police deliberately use a two-step strategy of questioning first without warnings and then giving warnings mid-interrogation, the subsequent statements are likely inadmissible. The Court evaluates the effectiveness of the midstream warnings based on:
            <ul>
                <li>Completeness and detail of first round of questioning</li>
                <li>Overlap in content between the two statements</li>
                <li>Timing and setting of both interrogations</li>
                <li>Continuity of police personnel</li>
                <li>Extent to which the interrogator treats the second round as continuous with the first</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

<div class="case-box">
    <h4><span class="case-name">New York v. Quarles</span> <span class="case-citation">467 U.S. 649 (1984)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">Police officers may question a suspect without providing Miranda warnings when necessary to address an immediate threat to public safety.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">After receiving a report that an armed man had entered a supermarket, police confronted Quarles, who matched the description. When he was apprehended, officers noticed an empty shoulder holster and, without giving Miranda warnings, asked where the gun was. Quarles nodded toward some empty cartons and said, "the gun is over there." After retrieving the gun, police then read Quarles his Miranda rights.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court created a "public safety" exception to the Miranda rule, holding that both the gun and Quarles' statement about its location were admissible. Justice Rehnquist, writing for the majority, explained that when public safety is threatened, "the need for answers to questions in a situation posing a threat to the public safety outweighs the need for the prophylactic rule protecting the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination." The Court noted that police in such urgent situations should not have to choose between protecting public safety and ensuring admissibility of evidence. The exception applies when officers ask questions reasonably prompted by a concern for public safety rather than solely to obtain incriminating evidence.</p>

<div class="case-box">
    <h4><span class="case-name">Missouri v. Seibert</span> <span class="case-citation">542 U.S. 600 (2004)</span></h4>
    <p class="case-rule">When police deliberately employ a two-step interrogation strategy—questioning first without warnings, then giving warnings and covering the same ground again—the midstream Miranda warnings are ineffective, and the post-warning statements are inadmissible.</p>
    <p class="case-facts">Police arrested Seibert for arson and murder. Following a department policy, officers intentionally questioned her without Miranda warnings until she confessed. After a 20-minute break, they gave her Miranda warnings, reminded her of her previous statements, and obtained the same information in a second confession.</p>
    <p class="case-reasoning">The Supreme Court held that Seibert's post-warning statements were inadmissible. Justice Souter, writing for a plurality, explained that the effectiveness of Miranda warnings depends on whether they can function as a meaningful choice to a suspect. When police deliberately use the "question first, warn later" tactic, the warnings come too late to be effective. The Court identified several factors for determining whether midstream warnings are effective: the completeness and detail of the questions and answers in the first round, the overlapping content of the two statements, the timing and setting of the first and second interrogations, the continuity of police personnel, and the degree to which the interrogator's questions treated the second round as continuous with the first. The Court distinguished this case from Oregon v. Elstad, where the initial unwarned statement was brief and the circumstances did not show a deliberate attempt to undermine Miranda.</p>
