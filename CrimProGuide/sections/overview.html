    <h3>Introduction to Criminal Procedure</h3>
    
    <p>Criminal procedure governs the process by which the government investigates, prosecutes, and adjudicates alleged violations of criminal law. Unlike substantive criminal law, which defines crimes and penalties, criminal procedure focuses on the constitutional and statutory rules that govern how the government must conduct itself when enforcing criminal laws.</p>
    
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>The Stakes in Criminal Procedure</h4>
        <p>Criminal procedure involves balancing competing interests:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Individual Liberty</strong>: Freedom from unreasonable government intrusion</li>
            <li><strong>Law Enforcement</strong>: Government's need to effectively investigate and prosecute crime</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy</strong>: Protection of personal information and spaces</li>
            <li><strong>Due Process</strong>: Fairness and reliability in the adjudicative process</li>
            <li><strong>Public Safety</strong>: Protection of the community from criminal activity</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>The rules of criminal procedure determine when and how the government may search, seize, arrest, interrogate, try, and punish individuals. These rules fundamentally shape the relationship between the government and its citizens in the criminal justice context.</p>
</div>

<div class="explanation" id="framework">
    <h3>Constitutional Framework</h3>
    
    <p>The U.S. Constitution provides the fundamental framework for criminal procedure. Key constitutional provisions include:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fourth Amendment</strong>: Prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, requires probable cause for warrants</li>
        <li><strong>Fifth Amendment</strong>: Protects against double jeopardy and self-incrimination, guarantees due process</li>
        <li><strong>Sixth Amendment</strong>: Guarantees right to counsel, trial by jury, confrontation of witnesses, and other trial rights</li>
        <li><strong>Eighth Amendment</strong>: Prohibits excessive bail, excessive fines, and cruel and unusual punishment</li>
        <li><strong>Fourteenth Amendment</strong>: Applies (incorporates) most Bill of Rights protections to the states via Due Process Clause</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The Supreme Court has interpreted these constitutional provisions over time, developing a complex body of case law that defines the scope and application of these rights in various contexts.</p>
